# ACFLS
Logic Synthesizer Project for ACF.

TODO:
- Create/find a suitable testproject. Ideally a simple RISC-V CPU in in Verilog for the final tests. In the beginning we will use a much smaller example, maybe a 4-bit counter, to see if our stuff works.

- Parser: reads the verilog and creates abstract syntax tree (AST), Ideally we use a tool here like PyVerilog. Otherwise this will be a LOT of work.

- Elaboration and Hierarchy flattening: traverses AST to resolve parameters, unroll loops and instantiate modules.

- Bit-Blasting / Macro generation: Convert A + B into explicit XOR/AND/OR gate structures, if ... into MUX logic

- Sequential Inference: Detect patterns (always @(posedge clk) and instantiate D-Flip-Flop primitive in the netlist)

- Logic Optimization (ambitious but optional)

- Export: writes a netlist into a standard format.

- get a reference netlist for comparion

We do Verilog, because it's easier than VHDL. 
Ideally the CPU testproject is limited and unoptimized, leaving out more complex types or features of Verilog. 
A minimum functional subset should be something like:
combinatorial logic, "assign" statements, logical operators(&,|,^,!) and arithmetic(+,-)

Sequential Logic: "always @(posedge clk)blocks, Flip Flops

Control Flow: "if-else", "case" (maps to MUXes)

Modules: module instatiation and port mapping.

ideally we can do without structs, enums, generate blocks, initial blocks, delays and tristates and so on.

I will also ask if we need to make the lexer/parser ourselves or if we can use an existing tool for that.
In terms of language, we can use any language. I would prefer Python but it will depend on the code available as reference online.
